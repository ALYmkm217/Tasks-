IMU 9250 : 

The MPU-9250 is a 9-axis MotionTracking device that combines a 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis magnetometer and a Digital motion processor.
 Based on the IC MPU-9250, which is the worldâ€™s smallest 9-axis MotionTracking device and incorporates the latest InvenSense design innovations, 

I2C and SPI serial interfaces

The sensor can be used in many application
 such as angle measurments ( yaw - pitch -roll),
 motion detection, gesture position
 or as pedometer for counting steps while walking
